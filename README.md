# Simple Web Site

This site was created by [Eric Brown](https://github.com/ericbrown8787)

## Description

This is a simple webpage showcasing the unnamed third poem(usually referred to as _In the Desert_) in Stephen Crane's 1895 book of poetry _The Black Riders and Other Lines_. The collection was originally printed with each poem differentiated by Roman numerals and using a small capitals font, and for this project I attempted to recreate those design choices in order to give readers a sense of what reading the original printing may have been like.
